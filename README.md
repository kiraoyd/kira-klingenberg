# kira-klingenberg: a personal website

A static 'about me' website built for CS510 at Portland State University.



This project is intended to showcase the HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT skills I built over the course of the 10-week Spring 2022 term in CS510: Intro to Web Development.

I am restarting development on this site as of July 2023. There are a number of known issues that still need fixing:

1. The contact form does not send emails on submit
2. Some accessibility issues remain
3. Some Responsive Web Design issues remain
4. HTML and CSS design choices need to be gone over and refactored
5. Javascript code is very basic and I'd like to boost this part up

This site is deployed via Github Pages, and can be seen live at:
